## Simple Blogging Platform in V

While this is very much still a work in progress, the project is currently in a usable state.

See [vblog.jeffvos.dev](https://vblog.jeffvos.dev) for the reference implementation.

Reference implementation is running on **Debian Linux**, using **MariaDB** for the database and **HAProxy** for HTTPS.

More documentation will be implemented in future.
